> **Note:** This is the first, last, and therefore *best* version of the Compliment App. Any grade lower than a 100% WILL NOT BE accepted

## 🚀 What's New?

Define new? What does it mean to you? That's what I think this app does. Loving this country requires the willingness to speak out for what is right. To shake up the status quo. That's America.

### ✨ Key Features
* **Instant Validation:** Generates compliments faster than the U.S. national debt grows.
* **Infinite Positivity Loop:** There is no "stop" button. Fentanyl level happiness is what we aimed for.
* **Sleek UI:** Minimalist design.
* **Bug-Free Experience:** *Any issues are USER error 🥰🥰*

## 🛠️ Tech Stack used to build this masterpiece
* **React:** They put the Zuck in Zuckerberg
* **CSS:** Because that's what union general Robert Shaw would have wanted 😔
* **Html:** Cause my boi braylon has been freed form ISS 🥹✊
